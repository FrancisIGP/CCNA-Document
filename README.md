## Document Background

### Version 0.1 (Updated 02/17/2021) <br/>

This document offers you in-depth explanation and multiple strategies you can use to learn Computer Networking. Computer networking is a broad topic because it encompasses many areas. This can be overwhelming for new students, and hence this book is designed to help guide students through their learning journey. Our work will give you a thorough understanding of the latest in network technology and design. 

Following the guide will help you understand the basics of computer networks, how local and global networks interact, and how to better the ones we already have. This guide will cover the fundamentals and concepts associated with Networking for your Networking 201-301 certification exam. This book will help you get started with your CCNA and prepare you for the certification exam.  <br/>
